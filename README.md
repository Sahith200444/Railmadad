# Rail Madad

Rail Madad is an innovative application designed for railway services that simplifies the process of lodging complaints. This machine learning-powered system enables passengers to file complaints by simply uploading a photo of the issue. The application then uses an image recognition model to analyze the photo, estimate the problem, and automatically route the complaint to the relevant railway authority for prompt action.

## Features

- **Automated Issue Detection:** Leverages machine learning to analyze uploaded images and identify the problem.
- **Streamlined Complaint Process:** Allows passengers to report issues quickly without the need for manual text entry.
- **Direct Authority Notification:** Automatically forwards the complaint details to the specific railway authority responsible for addressing the issue.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python (Flask or Django)
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn (depending on your implementation)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or a modern frontend framework)
- **Others:** RESTful APIs, database management, and more

## How It Works

1. **Photo Upload:** The passenger captures and uploads a photo of the issue.
2. **Image Processing:** The machine learning model analyzes the uploaded image to determine the nature of the problem.
3. **Problem Estimation:** The system classifies the issue based on the analysis.
4. **Complaint Registration:** The identified problem is automatically reported to the appropriate railway authority for resolution.
